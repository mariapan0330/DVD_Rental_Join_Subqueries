-- Q1: List all customers who live in Texas (use JOINs)--------------------> customer & address

-- Q5: Which film category has the most movies in it (show with the count)? --------------------> film_category > category
-- *(we did this in class. try doing it yourself or maybe find the film category with the LEAST movies in it)
-- A5: Most = Sports with 74 movies. Least = Music with 51 movies

-- MOST

-- Strategy2: Same as MOST but without desc keyword
-- LEAST

-- Q9: List the actors who have been in more than 3 films but less than 6. --------------------> film_actor > actor
-- Emily Dee from #7 was in the least amount of movies and she had 14. So, no actors have been in only 4 or 5 movies.
-- but here's that in code i guess

SELECT actor.first_name, actor.last_name, film_counter.film_count FROM (
	SELECT actor_id, count(*) AS film_count
	FROM film_actor
	GROUP BY actor_id
) AS film_counter
